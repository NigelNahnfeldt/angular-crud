# AngularCrud

was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

This project was my first dive into a CRUD application using the angular framework. Within there are components and services that use Observables, Subjects, Subscriptions, EventEmiiters, Input/Output, and Angular Routing.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Mock Backend
Run `npm run server` to mock a back end framework that holds tasks via a db.json file. To view the data stored in the server navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`.
